DX TE ML/ITO Readiness Event in Beijing 
We do believe that there is a relationship between soil temperature and air temperature .
To get a better harvest, farmers have to keep an appropriate soil temperature at plant growth phases. 
This solution collection soil temperature and air temperature by IOT hub, and then can be saved to SQL Azure by Stream Analytics. 
Finally ,we use regression algorithm to learn data and give farmers prediction about how exactly air temperature have to keep to 
get an appropriate temperature in soil.
